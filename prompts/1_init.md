I am creating a game, which is an isometric view. The game will have zombies and our goal is to kill the zombies.

The game can have different type of weapons like guns, machine, gun, rocket, launcher, et cetera.

The view is 3-D isometric.

The game will have levels from 1 to 10. Each level will get difficult over time.

The game will be structured in the way that new characters and features can be added over time.

The map of the game can also change. There will be different sounds to different levels. Each level can have different type of map. For example, the first level would have a simple map. The second level would be in cities. The third level would be volcanoes, the fourth level would be something different. The fifth level would be something different and have a boss similarly, for the other level levels, the 10th level will also have a boss.

The code structure in a way that we can change some things easily.

The game has to run on the web.

The game would also have different sounds depending on the level. Also, it will have different gun sounds and sounds of full footsteps.

At the initial screen, there will be a simple menu like video games have like start the game volume et cetera.

Note the game is built to be multiplayer, but initially during development, we won't focus on multiplayer so while developing it should work for both single player and eventually we can add multiplayer so the code has to be structured accordingly.

I want you to take this plan and create a good game development plan and a PRD. I want you to structure the task in small increments and also at some point. I want to have multiple agents working on the project together. So while initially we have a single agent creating the code at some point. Multiple agents will work on it, and so note the points which can be parallel.
