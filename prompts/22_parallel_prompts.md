okay. now create 3 folders in prompts 22_DEVELOPER_A, 22_DEVELOPER_B, 22_DEVELOPER_C. add prompts related to
them from execution plan within each file in the folder.

Each file in each of the folder would correspond to the step

for example

22_DEVELOPER_A/22_1_execute_Step_16

and it would include instruction to execute step 16.

- Developer A: Steps 16-18 (Combat)

 - Developer B: Steps 26-28 (Audio)

- Developer C: Steps 29-30 (Effects & UI)

Add hints for each developeer in each execution step how to avoid merge conflict
