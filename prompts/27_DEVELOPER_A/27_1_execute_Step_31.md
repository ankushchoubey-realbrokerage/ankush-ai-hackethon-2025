# Step 31: Level System Architecture

## Objective
Create a robust level loading system that supports dynamic level transitions and data management.

## Tasks
1. Create level loading system in `src/levels/level-system/LevelLoader.ts`
2. Implement level data structure interfaces in `src/types/level.types.ts`
3. Create level transition logic in `src/core/engine/GameEngine.ts`
4. Test level switching functionality

## Implementation Details

### 1. Level Data Structure
- Define `LevelData` interface with:
  - level number
  - theme
  - enemy spawn configurations
  - weapon pickups
  - environmental hazards
  - win conditions

### 2. Level Loader System
- Create `LevelLoader` class that:
  - Loads level configurations from `levelConfigs.ts`
  - Initializes level-specific entities
  - Manages level state transitions
  - Cleans up previous level resources

### 3. Level Transition Logic
- Implement smooth transitions between levels
- Add loading screen during transitions
- Save player state between levels
- Reset appropriate game state

## Merge Conflict Avoidance Tips
1. **DO NOT modify existing type unions yet** - We'll coordinate type changes in a separate commit
2. **Create new files** where possible instead of modifying shared ones
3. **If you must modify GameEngine.ts**:
   - Add your level transition methods at the END of the class
   - Use clear comment markers like `// STEP 31: Level System`
   - Avoid modifying existing methods - create new ones
4. **Communicate** before modifying any shared files
5. **Work in your assigned branch** and commit frequently

## Testing
- Create a simple test that switches between existing levels
- Verify player state persists correctly
- Ensure no memory leaks during transitions
- Test edge cases (dying during transition, etc.)

## Expected Deliverables
- `LevelLoader.ts` class implementation
- Extended `level.types.ts` interfaces (new interfaces only)
- Level transition methods in GameEngine
- Working demo of level switching
