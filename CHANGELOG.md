# Changelog

## Step 8: Mouse Aiming System - Completed ✅

### Features Added
1. **Mouse Position Capture**
   - Already working from InputManager
   - Real-time mouse tracking
   - Screen coordinates captured correctly

2. **Screen to World Coordinate Conversion**
   - MouseUtils utility class created
   - Proper isometric projection calculations
   - Accounts for orthographic camera
   - Player Y-plane intersection

3. **Player Rotation Based on Mouse**
   - Player rotates to face mouse cursor
   - Smooth rotation updates
   - Proper angle calculations
   - Works in all directions

4. **Aim Visualization**
   - Yellow aim line showing direction
   - Semi-transparent cone for spread visualization
   - Red dot at aim point
   - Rotates with player smoothly
   - Professional looking aim indicator

### Technical Implementation
- MouseUtils.screenToWorld() for coordinate conversion
- MouseUtils.calculateAimAngle() for rotation
- MouseUtils.getAimDirection() for normalized vectors
- Aim indicator as child of player mesh
- No performance impact

### Visual Features
- Clear aim line (8 units long)
- Cone showing potential spread
- Red targeting dot
- Yellow color scheme
- Semi-transparent for visibility

## Step 7: Player Movement - Completed ✅

### Features Added
1. **8-Directional Movement System**
   - Smooth WASD movement with proper diagonal normalization
   - All 8 directions working correctly (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
   - Movement vector properly normalized for consistent speed

2. **Velocity and Acceleration System**
   - Smooth acceleration when starting movement (20 units/s²)
   - Smooth deceleration when stopping (15 units/s²)
   - Maximum speed capped at 5 units/second
   - Current speed tracking for smooth transitions

3. **Movement Boundaries**
   - Play area restricted to -45 to 45 units in X and Z axes
   - Visual boundary walls added (semi-transparent)
   - Velocity properly stopped when hitting boundaries
   - No jittering or stuck states at boundaries

4. **Movement Testing Tools**
   - Enhanced debug display showing:
     - Real-time position tracking
     - Velocity vector display
     - Current speed in units/second
   - Visual boundary walls for spatial reference
   - 50ms update rate for smooth feedback

### Technical Implementation
- Separated target velocity from current velocity
- Smooth acceleration/deceleration functions
- Proper deltaTime integration
- Boundary clamping with velocity reset
- No physics glitches or overshooting

### Movement Feel
- Responsive start/stop
- Smooth acceleration curves
- Natural deceleration
- Consistent speed in all directions
- Professional game-feel achieved
