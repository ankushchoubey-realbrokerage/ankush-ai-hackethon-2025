# Changelog

## Step 7: Player Movement - Completed ✅

### Features Added
1. **8-Directional Movement System**
   - Smooth WASD movement with proper diagonal normalization
   - All 8 directions working correctly (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
   - Movement vector properly normalized for consistent speed

2. **Velocity and Acceleration System**
   - Smooth acceleration when starting movement (20 units/s²)
   - Smooth deceleration when stopping (15 units/s²)
   - Maximum speed capped at 5 units/second
   - Current speed tracking for smooth transitions

3. **Movement Boundaries**
   - Play area restricted to -45 to 45 units in X and Z axes
   - Visual boundary walls added (semi-transparent)
   - Velocity properly stopped when hitting boundaries
   - No jittering or stuck states at boundaries

4. **Movement Testing Tools**
   - Enhanced debug display showing:
     - Real-time position tracking
     - Velocity vector display
     - Current speed in units/second
   - Visual boundary walls for spatial reference
   - 50ms update rate for smooth feedback

### Technical Implementation
- Separated target velocity from current velocity
- Smooth acceleration/deceleration functions
- Proper deltaTime integration
- Boundary clamping with velocity reset
- No physics glitches or overshooting

### Movement Feel
- Responsive start/stop
- Smooth acceleration curves
- Natural deceleration
- Consistent speed in all directions
- Professional game-feel achieved
