# Changelog

## Step 10: Game State Management - Completed ✅

### Features Added
1. **Zustand Store Setup**
   - Created comprehensive game store with devtools integration
   - State persistence across components
   - Clean action-based state updates
   - TypeScript fully integrated

2. **Game States Implemented**
   - menu: Main menu state
   - playing: Active gameplay
   - paused: Game paused (ESC key)
   - gameOver: Player death state
   - Previous state tracking for transitions

3. **State Transition Logic**
   - startGame(): Resets stats and begins gameplay
   - pauseGame(): Only works when playing
   - resumeGame(): Only works when paused
   - gameOver(): Triggered on player death
   - returnToMenu(): Return from any state
   - ESC key toggles pause during gameplay

4. **State Testing & Debug**
   - StateDebugPanel component for real-time state monitoring
   - Visual state indicators
   - Button controls for all transitions
   - Health, score, and stats tracking
   - Verified all state transitions work correctly

### Technical Implementation
- Zustand store with middleware for dev tools
- Selector hooks for optimized re-renders
- Integration with GameEngine for pause handling
- HUD connected to game store for live updates
- Player health synced with store

### Store Features
- Game state management
- Player stats (health, max health)
- Game statistics (score, zombies killed, wave, level)
- Action methods for all state changes
- Reset functionality for new games

## Step 9: Basic Collision System - Completed ✅

### Features Added
1. **AABB Collision Detection**
   - Full Axis-Aligned Bounding Box implementation
   - CollisionInfo interface with entity, normal vector, and penetration depth
   - Accurate collision detection between all entities
   - World-space bounding box calculations

2. **Entity Collision System**
   - Dynamic entities (player, projectiles) tracked separately
   - Static entities (walls, obstacles) for optimization
   - Collision detection between all entity types
   - Proper collision response with push-out method

3. **World Boundaries Collision**
   - World bounds set to -45 to 45 on X/Z axes
   - Automatic constraint to world boundaries
   - No clipping through world edges
   - Smooth boundary collision handling

4. **Collision Testing & Debugging**
   - CollisionDebugger utility for visual debugging
   - F2 key toggles collision box visualization
   - Color-coded boxes (green=player, red=obstacles)
   - Test obstacles created (walls and pillars)
   - Verified player-wall collisions working correctly

### Technical Implementation
- Enhanced PhysicsEngine with detailed collision system
- Separation of static and dynamic entities for performance
- Collision resolution using normal vectors and penetration depth
- World-space transformations for accurate detection
- Push-out method prevents entity overlap

### Test Obstacles
- 4 boundary walls at edges of play area
- 2 pillar obstacles for interior testing
- All obstacles properly registered with physics
- Visual confirmation of collision prevention

## Step 8: Mouse Aiming System - Completed ✅

### Features Added
1. **Mouse Position Capture**
   - Already working from InputManager
   - Real-time mouse tracking
   - Screen coordinates captured correctly

2. **Screen to World Coordinate Conversion**
   - MouseUtils utility class created
   - Proper isometric projection calculations
   - Accounts for orthographic camera
   - Player Y-plane intersection

3. **Player Rotation Based on Mouse**
   - Player rotates to face mouse cursor
   - Smooth rotation updates
   - Proper angle calculations
   - Works in all directions

4. **Aim Visualization**
   - Yellow aim line showing direction
   - Semi-transparent cone for spread visualization
   - Red dot at aim point
   - Rotates with player smoothly
   - Professional looking aim indicator

### Technical Implementation
- MouseUtils.screenToWorld() for coordinate conversion
- MouseUtils.calculateAimAngle() for rotation
- MouseUtils.getAimDirection() for normalized vectors
- Aim indicator as child of player mesh
- No performance impact

### Visual Features
- Clear aim line (8 units long)
- Cone showing potential spread
- Red targeting dot
- Yellow color scheme
- Semi-transparent for visibility

## Step 7: Player Movement - Completed ✅

### Features Added
1. **8-Directional Movement System**
   - Smooth WASD movement with proper diagonal normalization
   - All 8 directions working correctly (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
   - Movement vector properly normalized for consistent speed

2. **Velocity and Acceleration System**
   - Smooth acceleration when starting movement (20 units/s²)
   - Smooth deceleration when stopping (15 units/s²)
   - Maximum speed capped at 5 units/second
   - Current speed tracking for smooth transitions

3. **Movement Boundaries**
   - Play area restricted to -45 to 45 units in X and Z axes
   - Visual boundary walls added (semi-transparent)
   - Velocity properly stopped when hitting boundaries
